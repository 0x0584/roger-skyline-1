* About

This is a guide to do all the things described in Roger Skyline 1. This might not take so much time, or let me say it otherwise, *I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME! I NEED TO GET OUT OF THE BLACK HOLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!*

* A Debian VM

For the moment, All of this is done on a =24-inch iMac (Late 2006)= running a Max OS X =Lion 10.7.5= using a =Debian 9.9= in =VirtualBox 4.3=

Here's a link to [[https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-10.0.0-amd64-netinst.iso][Debian 10.10 Net Install]] for latest packages + minimum download/install time. Also [[https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.0.10/VirtualBox-6.0.10-132072-OSX.dmg][VirtualBox 6.0]]. Important thing is to allocate exactly =8 GB= with no partitioning!

* Network and Security

** Initial Configuration

+ create a new non-root user using =adduser <NAME>=
+ update the system using =apt-get update -y && apt-get upgrade -y=
